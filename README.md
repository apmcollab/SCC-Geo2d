## SCC::Geo2d

The SCC::Geo2d classes are used to represent two-dimensional geometric objects with functionality for manipulation and interrogation. Currently supported are circle entities (SCC::CircleEntity), XY-rectangle entites (SCC::XYrectangleEntity) and closed polygon entities (SCC::PolygonEntity), and an aggregate entity (SCC::CombinedEntity) that combines a collection of entities into a single entity. 

These classes were created by updating and refactoring the CAMgeo2d classes.
